# Scripture AI

A specialized AI-powered question-answering system that uses a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) and vector embeddings to answer gospel-related questions using scriptures from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It leverages semantic search to retrieve the most relevant scriptures and doctrinal references, providing contextually grounded answers rooted in LDS canon.

## Features

*LLM-Powered Answers*: Combines retrieved scriptures with a custom LLM prompt to generate context-aware, doctrinally sound responses.
*LDS Canon Support*: Includes scriptures from:
- The King James Version of the Bible
- The Book of Mormon
- Doctrine and Covenants
